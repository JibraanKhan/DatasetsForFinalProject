      <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales/version/2">Video Game Sales</a>
      <p>This is a dataset that talks to the viewer about video games and the various
        statistics that go along with each video game. These statistics range anywhere
        from Rank to Global Sales. I am hoping to show the trends between the video
        game publisher and the rank that the video game has, pointing out the
        significance of a publisher for a video game. So, hopefully I can find trends
        between video game publishers and the rankings of the video games.

      <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jaimevalero/developers-and-programming-languages">Github Used Languages</a>
      <p>This is a dataset that shows 17,000 github users and what their skill level is
        in each of the 1,400 programming languages/technologies. This skill is based on
        how frequently the label appears in respect to all the other labels that appear
        for the user, so it is not the experience that the person has had but the
        frequency of the label that appears on their account based on the repositories
        that they have starred. With this dataset, I hope to find and show trends
        between programming languages/technologies and programmers themselves.
        Answering questions such as what language do most people on github hope to
        learn.
